## Predictive Maintenance of a Machine
This repository contains a predictive maintenance model for forecasting equipment failure based on historical sensor data. The goal is to predict potential machine failures and schedule timely maintenance, preventing unexpected downtimes and reducing maintenance costs.
## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess sensor data for use in machine learning models.
- **Model Building:** Build machine learning models to predict machine failure based on various features.
- **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization:** Visualize data trends and model predictions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - jupyterlab (optional, for notebook)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (if using deep learning models)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/predictive-maintenance.git
   cd predictive-maintenance
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

- The dataset used for training the model consists of historical sensor data, maintenance logs, and machine status records.
- Ensure you have the correct data format (e.g., CSV) before training the model.

## Usage

1. Preprocess the data:

   ```python
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. Train the predictive model:

   ```python
   python train_model.py
   ```

3. Evaluate the model:

   ```python
   python evaluate_model.py
   ```

4. Make predictions:

   ```python
   python predict.py
   ```

## Example

- The system can predict if a machine will fail within the next 'n' days based on sensor readings and maintenance history. Use the `predict.py` script to provide real-time data and receive failure predictions.
